Upwork holds a virtual kick-off event every January where the CEO and other leaders in the company talk about the year ahead. We were tasked with getting people pumped for a day of talks. Using Upwork’s brand identity we created video content to kick off this event and also to play in between speakers/sessions to keep the day moving along and attendees engaged.

The old ways of working are dead. That’s why so many turn to Upwork - where you don’t have to go into an office and life is flexible. What better way to talk about obsolete ways of working than an 80s style sitcom featuring old office supplies. I’m very pleased to introduce “Stapler and Fax”.

Upwork wanted to get out on Instagram, X and Facebook and wish their clients and freelancers a very happy holiday. We decided to use Jack, our beloved Zombie CEO to spread cheer to the masses.
