### Burrito Love

Chipotle is not your average food and beverage company. And by no means did they want your average corporate video. The challenge was to create a low/no budget corporate video for employees that really embodied the culture of the brand. Even though we were only paid in Burrito Bucks our video was 9-minutes long.We also created a  shortened teaser and a music video featuring our original song, "Burrito Love".

We also created print and OOH ads promoting the big burrito.
