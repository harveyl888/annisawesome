Fact - You can learn a lot about someone by the way they do their laundry.  
LG wanted to put their brand top of mind for millennials purchasing washer/dryer combos during the holiday season. Our campaign got consumers familiar with LG products by matching them up with their perfectly paired machine.

**Welcome to "The LG Laundry Love Lab"**

We created a mobile/online experience starting a conversation around laundry habits and compatibility. Inside **LG's Laundry Love Lab** was our star of the campaign, comedian Phoebe Robinson. She played our laundry love guru dishing out advice while pushing our online quiz which led users to their perfect washer and dryer. Going off the love theme we partnered with OKCupid to power the quiz.  

Upon the campaign's release it had some good press in [Advertising Age](https://adage.com/article/marketing-news-strategy/lg-okcupid-and-phoebe-robinson-hook-laundry-appliance-ads/2375171).
