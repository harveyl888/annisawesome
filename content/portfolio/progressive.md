Progressive wanted to promote their Name Your Price Tool by co-branding a TV spot with the 2016 all-female-summer-blockbuster, Ghostbusters. We shot with Mr. Paul Feig who also directed the new, Ghostbusters movie. Flo from Progressive had played many parts over the years but had never appeared as a ghost... until now. This spot aired throughout the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio.
