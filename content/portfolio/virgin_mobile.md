### Be Bleepin' Awesome

Back when flip phones were still cool, Virgin Mobile wanted to push specific models on the retail level as gifts for the holidays. We had a simple message, If you want to be fucking awesome (or bleepin' awesome) buy your kids one of these flip phones from Virgin Mobile. We collaborated with the Perlorian Brothers and created a campaign called “Be Bleepin’ Awesome” which included Print, Television, Digital and a YouTube contest. We also created a spectacular board in Times Square.
