{{< portfolio-segment-header title="Can Crush Campaign"  categories="TV" >}}

Back in the 2000’s, when we weren’t so politically correct,  it was still acceptable to create a campaign based on the idea that men should act like men. At least the men who drank Milwaukee’s Best Light. What better way to punish any whiff of unmanly behavior than to crush someone with a giant beer can falling from the sky? This campaign debuted during The World Series of Poker on ESPN and went on to make people laugh for years to come. It won One Show Bronze and continued on encompassing nearly 20 commercials.

These billboard ads ran at the same time as our can crushing TV spots. We created fake billboards for "unmanly" products and services that ran in high traffic areas for a couple of weeks. Then, overnight, the boards were seamlessly changed over so the next morning they appeared "crushed" by a giant beer can.

Billboard and Print ads were written to reinforce the positioning that Milwaukee's Best Light was "Brewed for a Man’s Taste".

How do you stand out in Playboy? We wanted to refresh our "Brewed for a Man’s Taste" campaign and go beyond mere airbrushed models so we turned to illustration. Riffing off classic American t-shirt art, the images represent a man's ultimate fantasy with a cliché headline for your viewing pleasure. These quickly became collectable posters as they were ripped out of Playboys and pinned up across America.

{{< portfolio-segment-header title="Milwaukee's Best Light - Branded Microsite" >}}

In 2006, creating branded microsites was all the rage. We created a brand new site for Milwaukee's Best Light in parallel with our can crushing/manliness campaign. In addition to a timeline of "Man Moments" and a collection of downloadable pinups, the site included some surprisingly difficult games in which users try to ogle a friend's sister without getting caught, attempt to not dance to Top 40, and struggle to hold back the tears after watching a sad movie with the guys.

{{< portfolio-segment-header title="The Beer Cannon - Viral Video (pre-social media)" >}}

Working with *The Barbarian Group*, We developed The Beer Cannon for the site, shooting a series of clips in which our anti-spokesman, Briggs, builds a cannon to shoot beer cans at various items. The videos were unleashed on YouTube, initially by fans, and then in tandem with a media buy on YouTube. The results were astronomical — over 2 million views on YouTube in a two-week period, making the clips some of the most viewed on the site amongst millions. Which was a lot in 2006. This was all done on virtually no budget and made appearances on media vehicles like CNN, the publicity bang per buck has been second to none.
