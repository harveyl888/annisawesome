Whether we like it or not, we all age. Like death and taxes it’s kind of inevitable. We can either fight it, or welcome it. Smarter Nutrition embraces aging, and in fact says, bring it on!  
The following executions are people talking about life after 40. The good, the bad but mostly the hilarious. Hilarious because it’s true. We may not all always verbalize these things, but everyone in this age group can certainly all relate.
