Writer of freelance copy. Conceptual thinker. Cultivator of small humans. I'm a minivan driving mama of 3 married to a sexy Brit bringing 20+ years of advertising knowledge to the table. I've worked at some hot shops on a wide range of clients from concept to finish. I’ve done pitches, fully integrated campaigns, social, branding, and I’ve executed a full-on Bar/Bat Mitzvah party for my twins.

I believe in old school advertising and the importance of building your brand. You must stand for something and have a point of view. Advertising works because it lives in our memory. It establishes preference and creates loyalty.

For fun I cook and think about learning to play the guitar. I have a gazillion creative side projects that I’ve started but not finished. 

If your brand needs bold, conceptual ideas, witty headlines, killer taglines, voice development, social content, a brand refresh or you’re just looking for an entertaining corporate video, let's talk. Or at least email me, I’m a professional. And a grown up.
