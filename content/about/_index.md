Writer of freelance copy. Conceptual thinker. Cultivator of small humans. I'm a minivan driving mama of 3 married to a sexy Brit bringing 20+ years of advertising knowledge to the table. I've worked at some hot shops on a wide range of clients from concept to finish. I’ve done pitches, fully integrated campaigns, social, branding, and I’ve executed a full-on Bar/Bat Mitzvah party for my twins pulling off an exquisite candy buffet.

For fun I cook and think about learning to play the guitar. I have a gazillion side projects that I’ve started but not finished. They live in the black abyss of creativity in a folder on my google drive.  

If your brand needs a real person for bold, conceptual ideas, witty headlines, killer taglines, voice development, social content, a brand refresh or you’re just looking for an entertaining corporate video, let's talk. Or at least email me.
